# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, including data preprocessing, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, advanced visualizations, and predictive modeling to uncover insights and patterns.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), contains passenger information such as survival status, age, class, and fare.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, created new features (`FamilySize`, `Title`).
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualized distributions of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between variable pairs, visualized correlations.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Created pair plots, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Conducted survival analysis, identified feature importance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trained and evaluated models (logistic regression, random forests).

## Results
Revealed patterns such as higher survival rates for higher classes and certain titles, providing a foundation for predictive modelling and further analysis.
