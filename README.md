## Dataset
The Titanic dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), contains passenger information such as survival status, age, class, and fare.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, created new features (`FamilySize`, `Title`).
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualized distributions of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between variable pairs, visualized correlations.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Created pair plots, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Conducted survival analysis, identified feature importance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trained and evaluated models (logistic regression, random forests).

## Results
Revealed patterns such as higher survival rates for higher classes and certain titles, providing a foundation for predictive modelling and further analysis.
